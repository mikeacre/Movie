media.py is used to create the movie objects in entertainmentcenter.py the Video class should never be created,
 it is only used by the movie or TvShow class to store information that fits both types of videos.

 Update entertainmentcenter.py with the movies/tv shows you wish to display and run. This will call
 fresh_tomatoes.py to create an HTML file with the information as website where users can view trailers of the movies listed.
